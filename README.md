## 🚀 SolPay — A Decentralized Medium with On-Chain Subscriptions

### 🧠 Problem

Platforms like **Medium, Substack, and Gumroad** control creator monetization:

* Platform fees eat into earnings
* Subscription logic is opaque and centralized
* Creators don’t truly own their audience or revenue

Web3 promised creator ownership — but **most solutions are too complex, NFT-heavy, or unusable**.

### 💡 Solution

**SolPay is a Medium-like publishing platform where subscriptions and content access are enforced directly on-chain using Solana.**

No NFTs.
No platform custody.
No subscriptions trapped inside Web2 databases.

Just wallets, subscriptions, and content — transparently.
